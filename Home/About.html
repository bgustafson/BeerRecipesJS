            The home page is the default landing page from which you can navigate to other locations.  The About page and the Contacts page are both working.
            The side panel on the first page with the details button will take you directly to the details page for that recipe of the month.
            Clicking on recipes brings you to the recipe index page.  From there, there are links to get details, review, find and submit new recipes.
        
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Extensions to this application would be to get the list from the home page working so that all that functionality exists.  And then the rating 
            systems needs to be defined.  This would likely be done by creating a rating table related to the recipe so that ther can be many reviews for 
            each recipe.  This will also mean that the rating field currently stored in the recipe table should either be removed and calculated on the fly, 
            or a trigger should be created that keeps that field up to date with the average rating for that recipe.
          </p>

            This is a pure JavaScript application built using Aptana Studio 3.  This application is best viewed in Chrome or 
            Firefox but will work in IE.  This application is being submitted as a homework assignment.  There is a companion application that is built 
            using ASP.NET MVC 4 and Entity Framework 4 that shares a similar UI and framework.  Ultimately the two applications would likely share the same data sources.
